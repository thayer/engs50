Let's break that down.
The objectives of this course are for you to learn

  * software design principles
  * good coding style, and documentation
  * debugging and testing
  * design and coding with a team
  * programming in C
  * programming on Unix
  * use of git for source-code management

The first few weeks of this course are a crash course in Unix and C.
Please be sure to follow the [CS50 coding
style]({{site.resources}}/CodingStyle.html) in all your C assignments.

Finally, you'll join a team of other students to design, build,
document, and test a large software project -- your very own Search
Engine !!
