# Emma Smithayer '12


Emma was a CS major and geography minor in the Class of 2012.
(She did her [honors thesis](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/abstracts/TR2012-720/) with me!)  After graduation, she worked on medical records software at **athenahealth** in Boston, then spent a year as a **Code for America** fellow in Richmond, Virginia.
She's now a software engineer at **Google** in San Francisco, working on telephony spam protection and caller ID for Android.
