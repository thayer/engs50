Grab my classroom demo code [password.c]({{site.examples}}/password.c),

```bash
mygcc password.c -o password
```
and **work in pairs** using gdb to track down the bug that allows a successful authentication when certain passwords are entered.

You should be able to use gdb to show where the bug is located.
