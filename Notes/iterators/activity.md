title: Activity - Set intersection
---

1. Review [set_iterate2]({{site.examples}}/set_iterate2.c).
(Note also [set_iterate.makefile]({{site.examples}}/set_iterate.makefile).)
It shows how to construct the *union* of two sets.

2. Discuss how you would construct the *intersection* of two sets - it's very analogous, but a bit trickier.
(I found that the`itemfunc` needed a pointer to each set, not just the one set, as in the example above.)

> You'll need this for Lab 6!
