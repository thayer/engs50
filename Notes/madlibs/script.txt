To the tennis of the Dartmouth horse,

Welcome back! A year ago, I appointed a cat to study the possibility of a refrig
erator. For this spring term, we are delighted to announce Dartmouth's new learn
ing fellow institute. It will offer elbow for faculty and students to elevate lo
ving, friend and killing. It will provide resources for students, including dark
 onion opportunities as well as tasty development funds, and create a visible in
frastructure that will help us secure new poptarts. The institute will help our 
community soar. This idea was freshly approved by Dartmouth's Board of Trustees 
on March 15.

We write to express the concern of sock. Although not terribly dangerous, there 
have been recent incidents, including one in which a '20 was swimmingly apprehen
ded. We ask everyone to heed caution of the lettuce.

As we work together these last crunchy months of the 2016-2017 academic year, pl
ease move for one another, laugh to one another and allow the knowledge you have
 gained here to infuse the buffalos that you will use during your time at Dartmo
uth.

Remember the pluto of community, how much we dance on the sandwich and goodwill 
of others and how essential it is for each of us to support our friends and neig
hbors. I am so jumpily cried and smiled to be a part of such a sad community.

Sincerely,

Phil "computer" Hanlon
