# DO NOT EDIT _config.yml directly; see _config-base

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog,
# values which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit
# after that.  For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded
# automatically when you use 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file,
# please restart the server process.

# We use 'kramdown' Markdown engine, because that is the default for
# Jekyll and (as of 5/1/2016) the only engine supported by GitHub
# (which renders Markdown when you visit a Markdown file in the
# browser). Similarly, GitHub supports the Rouge syntax highlighter,
# so we use it here too.  Note: "GitHub Pages will only support
# kramdown, Jekyll's default Markdown engine"

# Of course, CS50 uses Gitlab, not GitHub; see Gitlab's Markdown
