To the <noun> of the Dartmouth <noun>,

Welcome back! A year ago, I appointed a <noun> to study the possibility of a <noun>. For this spring term, we are delighted to announce Dartmouth's new <noun> institute. It will offer <noun> for faculty and students to elevate <noun/gerund>, <noun/gerund> and <noun/gerund>. It will provide resources for students, including <adjective> <noun> opportunities as well as <adjective> development funds, and create a visible infrastructure that will help us secure new <plural noun>. The institute will help our community soar. This idea was <adverb> approved by Dartmouth's Board of Trustees on March 15.

We write to express the concern of <noun>. Although not terribly dangerous, there have been recent incidents, including one in which a '20 was <adverb> apprehended. We ask everyone to heed caution of the <noun>.

As we work together these last <adjective> months of the 2016-2017 academic year, please <verb> for one another, <verb> to one another and allow the knowledge you have gained here to infuse the <plural noun> that you will use during your time at Dartmouth.

Remember the <noun> of community, how much we <verb> on the <noun> and goodwill of others and how essential it is for each of us to support our friends and neighbors. I am so <adverb> <past tense verb> and <past tense verb> to be a part of such a <adjective> community.

Sincerely,

Phil "<noun/gerund>" Hanlon
