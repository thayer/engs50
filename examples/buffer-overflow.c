   Description: This is a bad program! But its fun. The basic idea of
                of the program to input and manipulate strings using
                arrays of chars is fun. However, there is a serious flaw
		in the program. The book uses the function gets(). This
		is a seriously dangerous function call. DONT USE IT.
		INDEED, gcc on Linux treats it as if it doesn't even exist.

   Revised code taken from pg. 457 (Program 9.5) (Bronson) "First Book on ANSI C"

  the length of the next incoming line, the use of this function enables 
  malicious users to arbitrarily change a  running program's functionality 
  through a buffer overflow attack. It is strongly suggested that the fgets() 
  function be used in all cases. OK lets type in more that 50 chars and see
