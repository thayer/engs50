title: Activity - Design of TSE Indexer

1. Review the [Indexer Requirements spec]({{site.labs}}/Lab5/REQUIREMENTS.html).

2. What data structure would be a good representation for the *inverted index*?
An inverted index allows maps from *words* to *document IDs* - given a word, which documents contain that word?
And for each document, you'll want to know how many times did that word appear in that document.
