### Lab1

* for `shake.sh` be specific about whether the search should be case-sensitive (or insensitive) and whether the search should look for whole words (or whether partial matches are ok).
* clarify whether the words "in order" is the original order or alphabetical order.
* emphasize that `shake.sh` must take its argument from the command line.
* students complained that they "didn't see the point of this lab" and that it "requires hours of Googling".  to fix the latter would require almost giving them the answers, or to more strongly teach them how to find information through "man" and other tools.
